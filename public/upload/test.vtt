00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:04.351
Mr Magnussen, please
state your full name for the record.

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.996
Charles Augustus Magnussen.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.517
Mr Magnussen, how would you describe
your influence over the Prime Minister?

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.599
The British Prime Minister?

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.309
Any of the British Prime Ministers
you have known.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.360
I've never had the slightest influence
over any of them.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.309
Why would I?

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.880
I notice you've had seven meetings
at Downing Street this year.

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:30.795
Why?

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:33.510
Because I was invited.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.351
Can you recall
the subjects under discussion?

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.873
Not without being more indiscreet
than I believe is appropriate.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.749
Do you think it right
that a newspaper proprietor,

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.674
a private individual and,
in fact, a foreign national

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.036
should have such regular access
to our Prime Minister?

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.075
I don't think it's wrong

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.833
that a private individual
should accept an invitation.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.076
However, you have my sincere apologies
for being foreign.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.794
That's not what I meant.
That is not in any <i>way....</i>

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.110
Mr Magnussen, can you recall an occasion

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.112
when your remarks could have
influenced government policy?

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.920
Or the Prime Minister's thinking
in any way?

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.229
No.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.714
Are you sure?

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.156
I have an excellent memory.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.520
Your car is waiting outside
in the front, thank you.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.192
See you tomorrow.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.312
- May I join you?
- I don't think it's appropriate.

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.638
- It isn't?
- Mr Magnussen, outside the enquiry

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.234
we can have no contact,
no communication at all.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.511
Please don't do that.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:12.912
In 1982, your husband corresponded
with Helen Katherine Driscoll.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.754
That was before I knew him.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.876
The letters were lively, loving,

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.595
some would say explicit,

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.272
and currently in my possession.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.357
Will you please move your hand?

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.195
I long, my darling,
to know the touch of your body."

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.872
I know what was in the letters.

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.795
She was 15.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.632
She looked older.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.033
Oh, she looked delicious.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.479
We have photographs, too.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.998
The ones she sent him.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.199
Yum yum.

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.633
He was unaware of her age.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.676
He met her only once
before the letters began.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.595
When he discovered the truth,
he stopped immediately.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.238
Those are the facts.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.319
Facts are for history books,
I work in news.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.753
Your hand is sweating.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.554
Always, I'm afraid. I have a condition.

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.278
It's disgusting.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.472
Ah. I'm used to it.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.560
The whole world is wet to my touch.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.595
I will call someone,
I will have you removed.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:12.995
What is that?

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:19.549
Claire-de-la-lune?

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.234
Bit young for you, isn't it?

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.312
You want to hit me now?

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.152
Could you, still?

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.559
You're an old lady now.

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:33.756
Perhaps you should settle
for calling someone.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.430
Well, call him.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.357
No? Because now there are consequences.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.676
I have the letters
and therefore, I have you.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.319
This is blackmail.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.078
Of course it isn't blackmail.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.112
This is... ownership.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.478
You do not own me.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.669
Claire-de-la-lune.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.151
It never tastes like it smells,
does it?

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.639
Lady Smallwood's bill is on me.
See to it.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.234
Yes, Mr Magnussen.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.519
Oh, God!

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.389
You all right, ma'am?

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:41.395
Fine. Yes.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.429
Magnussen.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.633
No one stands up to him.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.472
No one dares, no one even tries.

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:50.998
There isn't a man or woman in England

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.469
capable of stopping
that disgusting creature.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.597
- Ma'am?
- Turn the car around.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:00.997
We're going back into town. Turn round.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.629
Where are we going, ma'am?

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.149
Baker Street.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.632
<i>Seen a lot of injuries, then?</i>

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:49.315
<i>Violent deaths?</i>

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.753
<i>Enough for a lifetime.</i>

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.956
<i>- Want to see some more?</i>
<i>Oh, God, yes.</i>

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:56.234
<i>The game is on.</i>

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:05.956
I know it's early.
Really, I'm sorry.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.872
- Is that Kate?
- Yeah, it's Kate.

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.109
Going to invite her in?

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.952
Uh, sorry, yes.
Do you want to come in, Kate?

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.553
Hey!

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.309
Sorry.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.474
- There you go.
- It's Isaac.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.788
- Ah, your husband?
- Son.

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.309
Son, yeah.

00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:24.634
He's gone missing again.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:26.273
- Didn't come home last night.

00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.912
- The usual.
- He's the drugs one, yeah?

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.230
Yeah, nicely put, John.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:34.834
Well, is it Sherlock Holmes you want?
Because I've not seen him in ages.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.751
- About a month.
- Who's Sherlock Holmes?

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:38.592
See? That does happen.

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:43.118
There's a place they all go to,
him and his friends.

00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:47.310
<i>They all... do whatever they do.</i>

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.477
Shoot up, whatever you call it.

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:52.629
Where is he?

00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.268
It's a house. It's a dump,
I mean, it's practically falling down.

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.435
No, the address.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.559
Where exactly?

00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:00.159
- Seriously?
- Why not?

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.878
She's not going to the police,
someone's got to get him.

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:03.552
- Why you?
- Being neighbourly.

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:04.715
Since when?

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.711
Since now. Since this exact minute.

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.435
- Why are you being so...
- What?

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:11.158
Oh, I don't know.
What's the matter with you?

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:13.350
There is nothing the matter with me!

00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.839
Imagine I said that without shouting.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.239
I'm trying.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.118
No, you can't come, you're pregnant.

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.394
You can't go, I'm pregnant.

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.479
What is that?

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:32.359
- It's a tyre lever.
- Why?

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.959
Because there were loads of
smackheads in there

00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:35.473
and one of them might need help
with a tyre.

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:37.717
If there's any trouble,
just go, I'll be fine.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.873
Wait, John. John, John, John...

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:42.754
It is a tiny bit sexy.

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:44.589
Yeah, I know.

00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:49.795
Hello?

00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:54.193
- What do you want?
- Excuse me.

00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.870
Hey, you can't come in here.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.269
I'm looking for a friend.

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.230
A very specific friend.

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.475
I'm not just browsing.

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:06.559
You gotta go.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.239
No one's allowed here.

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:10.318
Isaac Whitney,
you seen him?

00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:14.073
I'm asking you
if you've seen Isaac Whitney

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.549
and now you're showing me a knife.
Is it a clue?

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.309
You doing a mime?

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:21.834
Go. Or I'll cut you.

00:09:22.080 --> 00:09:23.354
Ooh, not from there.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:24.829
Let me help.

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:31.074
Now, concentrate. Isaac Whitney.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.554
Okay, you asked for it.

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.793
Right, are you concentrating yet?

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.914
- You broke my arm.
- No, I sprained it.

00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:45.754
It feels squishy.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:47.599
Is it supposed to feel squishy?

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.831
- Feel that.
- Yeah, it's a sprain.

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.916
I'm a doctor,
I know how to sprain people.

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.797
Now, where is Isaac Whitney?

00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.029
I don't know.

00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.269
Maybe upstairs.

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:59.430
There you go. Wasn't that easy?

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:04.190
No, it was really sore.
Mental, you are.

00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.874
No, just used to a better class
of criminal.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:21.478
Isaac? Isaac Whitney?

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.389
Isaac?

00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:30.313
Hello, mate. Sit up for me?

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.549
Sit up.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.638
Dr Watson?
- Yep.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.229
Where am I?

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.754
Arse-end of the universe
with the scum of the Earth. Look at me?

00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:40.353
Have you come for me?

00:10:41.360 --> 00:10:42.793
Do you think
I know a lot of people here?

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:44.915
Hey, you all right?

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.794
Oh, hello, John.

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:50.119
Didn't expect to see you here.

00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.108
Come for me, too?

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:00.277
- Hello, Isaac.
- Mrs Watson, can I...

00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:01.839
Can I get in, please?

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:02.995
Yes, of course, get in.

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:04.798
- Where's John?
- They're having a fight.

00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:06.075
Who is?

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.994
- For God's sakes, John. I'm on a case.
- A month, that's all it took.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.633
- One!
- I'm working.

00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.435
Sherlock Holmes in a drug den,
how is that going to look?

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.596
- I'm undercover.
- No, you're not.

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.671
Well, I'm not now!

00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.751
In, both of you, quickly.

00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.593
Please, can I come?
I think I got a broken arm.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.954
- No, go away.
- No, let him.

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:33.190
- Why?
- Yeah, just get in. It's a sprain.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.108
Anyone else? I mean, we're taking
everybody home, are we?

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:41.430
- All right, Shezza?
- Shezza?

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.794
I was undercover.

00:11:42.880 --> 00:11:44.074
Seriously, Shezza, though?

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.718
We're not going home,
we're going to Barts.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.119
- I'm calling Molly.
- Why?

00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:50.392
Because Sherlock Holmes
needs to pee in a jar.

00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.957
Well, is he clean?

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:06.429
Clean?

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.353
How dare you throw away
the beautiful gifts you were born with?

00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:20.391
And how dare you betray
the love of your friends!

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.469
Say you're sorry.

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.313
Sorry your engagement's over.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.992
Though I'm fairly grateful
for the lack of a ring.

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:26.149
Stop it.

00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.512
Just stop it.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:30.955
If you were anywhere
near this kind of thing again

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:32.598
you could have called,
you could have talked to me.

00:12:32.680 --> 00:12:34.989
Oh, please, do relax.
This is all for a case.

00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.116
A ca... What kind of case
would need you doing this?

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:39.919
I might as well ask you
why you've started cycling to work?

00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.832
No, we're not playing this game.

00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:44.157
Quite recently, I'd say,
you're very determined about it.

00:12:44.240 --> 00:12:46.515
- Not interested.
- I am. Ow!

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:49.468
Oh, sorry, you moved,
but it is just a sprain.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:51.911
- Yeah, somebody hit me.
- Huh?

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.668
Yeah, just some guy.

00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:59.429
Yeah, it was probably just an addict
in need of a fix.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:02.479
Yes, I think in a way it was.

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:05.392
- Is it his shirt?
- I'm sorry?

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.153
Well, it's the creases, innit?

00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.039
The two creases down the front?

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.190
It's been recently folded
but it's not new.

00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:17.032
You must have dressed in a hurry
this morning.

00:13:17.960 --> 00:13:20.076
So all your shirts
might be kept like that.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.319
But why?

00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:25.755
Maybe 'cause you cycle
to work every morning,

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:27.034
shower when you get there

00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.633
and then dress in the clothes
you brought with you.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:33.589
You keep your shirts folded,
ready to pack.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:37.395
- Not bad.
- And I further deduce...

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:41.993
you've only started recently
because you've got a bit of chafing.

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:46.194
No, he's always walked like that.
Remind me, what's your name again?

00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.312
- They call me The Wig.
- No, they don't.

00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:52.159
- Well, they call me Wiggy.
- Nope.

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.315
Bill. Bill Wiggins.

00:13:57.680 --> 00:13:59.671
Nice observational skills, Billy.

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.275
Ah, finally!

00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:06.750
- Finally what?
- Good news?

00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:09.434
Oh, excellent news, the best.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.280
There's every chance that my drug habit
might hit the newspapers.

00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:13.349
The game is on.

00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.031
Excuse me for a second.

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:21.950
<i>You've heard of</i>
<i>Charles Augustus Magnussen, of course?</i>

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.471
Yeah, owns some newspapers.

00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:25.669
Ones I don't read.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.990
Hang on. Weren't there other people?

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:31.152
Mary's taking the boys home,
I'm taking you. We did discuss it.

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:34.278
People were talking, none of them me,
I must have filtered.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.874
- I noticed.
- Had to filter a load of witless babble,

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.916
I've had Mrs Hudson
on semi-permanent mute.

00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:44.157
What is my brother doing here?

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:46.994
So I'll just pay, then, shall I?

00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:49.229
He's straightened the knocker.

00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:51.151
He always corrects it. He's OCD.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:52.554
Doesn't even know he's doing it.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.713
- Why did you do that?
- Do what?

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.155
Nothing.

00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.520
Well, then, Sherlock, back on the sauce?

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:02.829
What are you doing here?

00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:06.196
- I phoned him.
- The siren call of old habits.

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:07.759
How very like Uncle Rudy,

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.196
though in many ways, crossdressing
would've been a wiser path for you.

00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.713
- You phoned him?
- Course I bloody phoned him.

00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:15.599
Course he bloody did.
Now, save me a little time.

00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:16.795
Where should we be looking?

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:18.279
- We?
Mr Holmes?

00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.872
For God's sake!

00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:28.440
- Anderson?
- Sorry Sherlock, it's for your own good.

00:15:29.440 --> 00:15:31.829
Oh, that's him, isn't it?

00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:33.035
He's said to be taller.

00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:36.476
Some members of your little fan club,
to be polite.

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.153
They're entirely trustworthy.

00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:40.555
Even willing to search through
the toxic waste dump

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:42.039
that you were pleased to call a flat.

00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.992
You're a celebrity these days, Sherlock.
You can't afford a drug habit.

00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:48.475
I do not have a drug habit.

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:50.471
Hey, what happened to my chair?

00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:51.959
It was blocking my view to the kitchen.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:53.189
Well, it's good to be missed.

00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:54.679
Yeah, you were gone,
I saw an opportunity.

00:15:55.280 --> 00:15:56.315
No, you saw the kitchen.

00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:58.279
What have you found so far?
Clearly nothing.

00:15:58.360 --> 00:15:59.952
There's nothing to find.

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:02.959
Your bedroom door is shut,
you haven't been home all night.

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:06.112
So, why would a man who has never
knowingly closed the door

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.431
without the direct orders of his mother
bother to do so on this occasion?

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:11.078
Okay, stop! Just stop!

00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:14.229
- Point made.
- Jesus, Sherlock.

00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:17.632
I'll have to phone our parents,
of course, in Oklahoma.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.959
Won't be the first time
that your substance abuse

00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:22.598
has wreaked havoc
with their line dancing.

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.355
This is not what you think,
this is for a case.

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.311
What case could possiblyjustify this?

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.277
Magnussen.

00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:34.874
Charles Augustus Magnussen.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.754
That name you think
you may have just heard,

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:42.989
you were mistaken.

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:46.595
If you ever mention hearing that name
in this room, in this context,

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.319
I guarantee you on behalf
of the British Security Services

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:52.278
that materials will be found
on your computer hard drives

00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:54.715
resulting in your
immediate incarceration.

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:57.758
Don't reply, just look frightened
and scuttle.

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:03.153
I hope I won't have to
threaten you as well.

00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:07.274
Well, I think we both find
that embarrassing.

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.794
- Magnussen is not your business.
- Oh, you mean he's yours?

00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:12.677
You may consider him
under my protection.

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:14.193
I consider you under his thumb.

00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:16.152
If you go against Magnussen,

00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:18.595
then you will find yourself
going against me.

00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.398
Okay, I'll let you know if I notice.

00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:22.751
Erm... What was I going to say?

00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:24.398
Oh, yeah. Bye-bye.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:30.839
Unwise, brother mine.

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:36.117
- Brother mine...

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:39.516
Don't appal me when I'm high.

00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:42.592
Mycroft, don't say another word,
just go. He could snap you in two

00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:46.229
and right now,
I'm slightly worried that he might.

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.551
Don't speak, just leave.

00:18:03.640 --> 00:18:05.278
Uh, Magnussen?

00:18:05.360 --> 00:18:07.112
- What time is it?
- About 8:00.

00:18:07.600 --> 00:18:10.478
I'll be meeting him
in three hours. I need a bath.

00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:12.278
- It's for a case, you said.
- Yep.

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.639
- What sort of case?
- Too big and dangerous

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.278
for any sane individual
to get involved in.

00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:18.920
- You're trying to put me off?
- God, no.

00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:21.073
I'm trying to recruit you.

00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:24.756
And stay out of my bedroom.

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.639
Oh, John, hi.

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.516
- How are you?
- Janine?

00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.079
Sorry, not dressed.

00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:42.795
Has everybody gone? I heard shouting.

00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:44.035
Yes, they're gone.

00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.156
God, look at the time, I'll be late.

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.559
Sounded like an argument.

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.278
- Was it Mike?
- Mike?

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.477
Mike, yeah, his brother, Mike?
They're always fighting.

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:53.788
Mycroft?

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.348
- Do people actually call him that?
- Yeah.

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:58.352
Oh, could you be a love
and put some coffee on?

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.473
- Sure, right, yeah.
- Thanks.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:02.238
Ooh, how is Mary?

00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:03.719
How's married life?

00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:06.553
She's fine, we're both fine. Yep.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.358
Oh, it's over there now.

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.317
- Where's Sherl?
- Sherl.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:12.633
He's just having a bath.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.153
I'm sure he'll be out in a minute.

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:15.719
Oh, well, like he ever is!

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:16.829
Yeah.

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:20.878
Morning!

00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.036
Morning.

00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:33.916
So, she's just a guest but you've
probably got some questions.

00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:36.556
Yeah, one or two, pretty much.

00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:37.869
Naturally.

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.353
You have a girlfriend?

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.429
Yes, I have.

00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:50.320
Now, Magnussen.
Magnussen is like a shark.

00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:51.719
That's the only way I can describe him.

00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:54.070
Have you ever been to the shark tank
at the London Aquarium, John?

00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:55.593
Stood up close to the glass, those...

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:59.750
floating, flat faces, those dead eyes?

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.713
That's what he is.

00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:07.271
I've dealt with murderers, psychopaths,
terrorists, serial killers.

00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:13.030
None of them can turn my stomach
like Charles Augustus Magnussen.

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.109
Yes, you have.

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.674
- Sorry, what?
- You have a girlfriend?

00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:21.877
What? Yes, I'm going out with Janine.
I thought that was fairly obvious.

00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:24.474
Yes. Well, yes...

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:27.154
But I mean, you...
You are in a relationship?

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:30.590
- Yes, I am.
- You and Janine?

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:32.432
Hmm. Yes, me and Janine.

00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:35.031
Care to elaborate?

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:37.076
Well, we're in a good place, it's, um,

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:39.995
very affirming.

00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:43.277
- You got that from a book.
- Everyone got that from a book.

00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:46.796
Okay, you two bad boys,
behave yourselves.

00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:50.157
You, Sherl, you're going to have to
tell me where you were last night.

00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.878
- Working.
- Working?

00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:55.557
Of course. I'm the only one
who really knows what you're like.

00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.710
- Remember?
- Don't you go letting on.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:01.516
I might just, actually.

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:06.469
I haven't told Mary about this,
I kind of wanted to surprise her.

00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.069
Yeah, I think you probably will.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.878
But we should have you two
over for dinner

00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.188
- really soon.
- Yeah.

00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:13.794
My place, though, not the scuzz dump.

00:21:14.520 --> 00:21:17.080
Great, yeah. Dinner! Yeah.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:18.714
Oh, I'd better dash.

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:20.552
- It was brilliant to see you.
- You, too.

00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:26.392
Have a lovely day. Call me later.

00:21:26.920 --> 00:21:29.115
I might do. I might call you.

00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:31.558
Unless I meet someone prettier.

00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.711
Solve me a crime, Sherlock Holmes.

00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:50.991
You know Magnussen as a newspaper owner
but he is so much more than that.

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.589
He uses his power and wealth
to gain information.

00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:56.990
The more he acquires,
the greater his wealth and power.

00:21:57.080 --> 00:21:58.433
And I'm not exaggerating when I say

00:21:58.520 --> 00:21:59.839
that he knows
the critical pressure point

00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.911
on every person of note or influence

00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.798
in the whole of the Western world
and probably beyond.

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:07.394
He is the Napoleon of blackmail.

00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:09.072
And he has created

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:12.038
an unassailable architecture
of forbidden knowledge.

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:15.479
Its name is Appledore.

00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.557
- Dinner.
- Sorry, what, dinner?

00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:23.792
Me and Mary coming for dinner
with wine and...

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:26.590
sitting.

00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:28.796
Seriously? I've just told you
that the Western world

00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:31.553
is run from this house
and you want to talk about dinner?

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:32.709
Fine, talk about the house.

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:38.277
It is the greatest repository
of sensitive and dangerous information

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:39.349
anywhere in the world.

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:42.638
The Alexandrian library
of secrets and scandals.

00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:44.517
And none of it is on a computer.

00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:46.670
He's smart. Computers can be hacked.

00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:49.399
It's all on hard copy in vaults
underneath that house.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:50.708
And as long as it is,

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:54.190
the personal freedom of anyone
you've ever met is a fantasy.

00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:55.474
Yoo-hoo.

00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.471
Oh, that was the doorbell.
Couldn't you hear it?

00:22:57.560 --> 00:22:58.788
It's in the fridge. It kept ringing.

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.952
- Oh, that's not a fault, Sherlock.
- Who is it?

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:09.835
Mr Holmes says you can go right up.

00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:20.317
Go ahead.

00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:23.669
Sir?

00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:25.509
Can I have a moment?

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.639
He's fine.

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:33.437
Look, I...
Right, I should probably tell you...

00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:36.713
Okay, I... That...

00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:38.429
- <i>And....</i>

00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:45.038
Doesn't mean I'm not pleased to see you.

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.237
I can vouch for this man,
he is a doctor.

00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:48.833
If you know who I am,
then you know who he is.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:52.118
Don't you, Mr Magnussen?

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:56.472
I understood we were meeting
at your office.

00:23:58.040 --> 00:23:59.359
This is my office.

00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.556
Well, it is now.

00:24:12.080 --> 00:24:15.311
Mr Magnussen,
I have been asked to intercede with you

00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:17.311
by Lady Elizabeth Smallwood

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:19.233
on the matter of her husband's letters.

00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:25.155
Some time ago you put pressure on her
concerning those letters.

00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:27.552
She would like those letters back.

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.554
Obviously the letters no longer have
any practical use to you

00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:34.993
so with that in mind...

00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:39.274
Something I said?

00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:41.271
No, no. I was reading.

00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:45.119
There's rather a lot.

00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:49.713
Redbeard.

00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:55.718
Sorry. Sorry, you were
probably talking?

00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:58.789
I...

00:24:58.920 --> 00:25:01.593
I was trying to explain that
I have been asked to act on behalf...

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:04.633
- Bathroom?
- Along from the kitchen, sir.

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:06.395
Okay.

00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:09.074
I've been asked to negotiate
the return of those letters.

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.668
I'm aware you do not
make copies of sensitive documents...

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.830
Is it like the rest of the flat?

00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:15.599
- Sir?
- The bathroom?

00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:18.630
- Yes, sir.
- Maybe not, then.

00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:21.869
Am I acceptable to you
as an intermediary?

00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:28.237
Lady Elizabeth Smallwood.

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.833
I like her.

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:36.234
Mr Magnussen, am I acceptable to you
as an intermediary?

00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:37.992
She's English with a spine.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.831
Best thing about the English...

00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:49.637
You're so domesticated.

00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:54.110
Always standing around, apologising.

00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.598
Keeping your little heads down.

00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:00.479
You can do what you like here,

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:01.954
no one's ever going to stop you.

00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:05.999
A nation of herbivores.

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.630
I've interests
all over the world but, uh,

00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.233
everything starts in England.

00:26:13.240 --> 00:26:15.071
If it works here...

00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.952
<i>....</i> I'd try it in a real country.

00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:25.237
The United Kingdom, eh?

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:28.599
Petri dish to the Western world.

00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:33.028
Tell Lady Elizabeth
I might need those for later, so...

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.077
I'm keeping them.

00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:39.598
Goodbye.

00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:41.759
Anyway...

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:45.479
<i>....</i> They're funny.

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:53.074
Jesus!

00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:56.000
Did you notice
the one extraordinary thing he did?

00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:00.359
There was a moment
that kind of stuck in the mind, yeah.

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:02.431
Exactly. When he showed us the letters.

00:27:03.840 --> 00:27:04.875
Okay.

00:27:04.960 --> 00:27:06.279
So, he's brought the letters to London.

00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:08.476
So no matter what he says,
he's ready to make a deal.

00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:09.879
Now, Magnussen only makes a deal

00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:12.076
once he's established
a person's weaknesses,

00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.673
the "pressure point", he calls it.

00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:17.150
So, clearly he believes I'm
a drug addict and no serious threat.

00:27:18.800 --> 00:27:21.075
And of course,
because he's in town tonight,

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.031
the letters will be in his safe,
in his London office,

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:24.997
while he's out to dinner with the
Marketing Group of Great Britain

00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.071
- from 7:00 till 10:00.
- How do you know his schedule?

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:29.913
Because I do. Right, I'll see you
tonight. I've got some shopping to do.

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.275
- What's tonight?
- I'll text instructions.

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:34.157
I'll text you if I'm available.

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.389
You are, I checked!

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:38.552
- Don't bring a gun.
- Why would I bring a gun?

00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:41.598
Or a knife or a tyre lever, probably
best not to do any arm-spraining

00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.193
but we'll see how the night goes.

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.077
You're just assuming I'm coming along?

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:46.195
Time you got out of the house, John.

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:47.315
You've put on seven pounds
since you got married

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.799
and the cycling isn't doing it.

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.314
It's actually four pounds.

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:54.789
Mary and I think seven. See you later.

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.434
<i>And breaking news now,</i>

00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:14.956
<i>John Garvie, MP, has been arrested today</i>
<i>on charges of corruption.</i>

00:28:15.480 --> 00:28:18.552
<i>This follows an investigation into</i>
<i>information acquired...</i>

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:24.513
Magnussen's office is on the top floor,
just below his private flat.

00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.235
There are 14 layers of security
between us and him...

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:29.953
<i>....</i> Two of which aren't even
legal in this country.

00:28:30.040 --> 00:28:31.473
Want to know how
we're going to break in?

00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:33.949
- Is that what we're doing?
- Of course it's what we're doing.

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:39.428
Magnussen's private lift, goes straight
to his penthouse and office.

00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:42.671
Only he uses it and only his key card
calls the lift.

00:28:43.240 --> 00:28:46.118
Anyone else even tries,
security is automatically informed.

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:48.799
Standard key card for the building.

00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.909
Nicked it yesterday.
Only gets us as far as the canteen.

00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:54.914
Here we go, then.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.752
If I was to use this card
on that lift now,

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:57.989
- what happens?

00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:01.318
The alarms would go off
and you'd be dragged away by security.

00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:02.389
Exactly.

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:05.199
You're taken to a small room somewhere,
your head kicked in.

00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:09.273
- Do we really need so much colour?
- It passes the time.

00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:13.837
But if I do <i>this....</i> If you press
a key card against your mobile phone

00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:17.356
for long enough, it corrupts the
magnetic strip, the card stops working.

00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:20.079
It's a common problem, never put
your key card with your phone.

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:21.879
What happens if I use the card now?

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:24.433
It still doesn't work.

00:29:24.520 --> 00:29:26.397
But it doesn't read as
the wrong card now.

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:28.398
It registers as corrupted.

00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:31.069
But if it's corrupted, how do they
know it's not Magnussen?

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:32.549
Oh.

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:35.594
Would they risk dragging him off?
Probably not.

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:38.230
So what do they do?
What do they have to do?

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:39.833
Check if it's him or not.

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:43.080
There's a camera at eye height
to the right of the door.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:50.152
A live picture of the card user

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:53.198
is relayed directly to Magnussen's
personal staff in his office,

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:56.158
the only people trusted
to make a positive ID.

00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:59.516
<i>At this hour, almost certainly his PA.</i>

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:02.474
So, how does that help us?

00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:05.673
Human error. I've been shopping.

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:09.989
Here we go, then.

00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:13.912
You realise you don't exactly
look like Magnussen?

00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:16.509
Which, in this case,
is a considerable advantage.

00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:28.635
Sherlock, you complete loon,
what are you doing?

00:30:28.760 --> 00:30:30.716
- Hang on, is that...
- Hi, Janine.

00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:33.598
<i>Go on, let me in.</i>

00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:36.480
I can't, you know I can't.
Don't be silly.

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:40.030
Don't make me do it out here, not...

00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:41.473
in front of everyone.

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:44.395
Do what in front of everyone?

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:02.036
You see? As long as there's people,
there's always a weak spot.

00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:03.792
- That was Janine.
- Yes, of course it was Janine,

00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.438
she's Magnussen's PA,
that's the whole point.

00:31:05.520 --> 00:31:07.590
Did you just get engaged
to break into an office?

00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.159
Yeah. Stroke of luck

00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.390
meeting her at your wedding.
You can take some of the credit.

00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:14.677
Je... Jesus, Sherlock, she loves you.

00:31:14.760 --> 00:31:17.752
Yes. Like I said, human error.

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:21.109
What are you going to do?

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:23.270
Well, not actually marry her, obviously.

00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:24.873
There's only so far you can go.

00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:26.793
So what will you tell her?

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.551
Well, I'll tell her that our entire
relationship was a ruse

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:30.789
to break into her boss's office.

00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:33.394
I imagine she'll want to stop seeing me
at that point

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:34.595
but you're the expert on women.

00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:45.068
So, where did she go?

00:31:45.160 --> 00:31:47.071
That's a bit rude.
I just proposed to her.

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:48.869
Sherlock.

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:50.709
Did she faint?

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:52.474
Do they really do that?

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:56.113
It's a blow to the head.
She's breathing.

00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:58.352
- Janine.

00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:00.229
Another in here.

00:32:01.520 --> 00:32:02.509
Security.

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:04.435
Does he need help?

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:11.956
Ex-con, white supremacist
by the tattoos, so who cares?

00:32:12.040 --> 00:32:13.712
Stick with Janine.

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:17.798
Janine, focus on my voice now.
Can you hear me?

00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:28.716
Hey!
They must still be here.

00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:31.151
So is Magnussen,
his seat's still warm,

00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:33.196
he should be at dinner
but he's still in the building.

00:32:33.800 --> 00:32:35.392
- Upstairs.
- We should call the police.

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:38.597
During our own burglary? You're really
not a natural at this, are you?

00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:41.109
- No, wait, shh...

00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:45.153
Perfume. Not Janine's.

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:49.790
Claire-de-la-lune. Why do I know it?

00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:51.795
Mary wears it.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:53.274
No, not Mary, somebody else.

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:57.713
Sherlock!

00:33:04.240 --> 00:33:08.552
Coming here?
What... What would your husband think?

00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:12.235
<i>He....</i> Your lovely husband.
He's honourable.

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:16.194
- What would he say to you now?

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.309
You're doing this to protect
him from the truth?

00:33:21.760 --> 00:33:23.990
What is this obsession here
with honesty?

00:33:24.360 --> 00:33:25.952
Additionally,
if you're going to commit murder,

00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:28.315
you might consider
changing your perfume,

00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:29.954
Lady Smallwood.

00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.870
Sorry, who?

00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:42.833
That's not Lady Smallwood, Mr Holmes.

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:57.517
- Is John with you?
- He's, um...

00:33:58.240 --> 00:33:59.912
Is John here?

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:02.195
He's downstairs.

00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.509
So, what do you do now?

00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:08.435
Kill us both?

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:11.274
Mary, whatever he's got on you,

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:13.068
let me help.

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:15.880
Oh, Sherlock, if you take one more step,
I swear I will kill you.

00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:17.755
No, Mrs Watson,

00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.759
you won't.

00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:30.031
I'm sorry, Sherlock.

00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:31.669
Truly I am.

00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:34.229
Mary.

00:34:42.520 --> 00:34:44.351
It's not like it is in the movies.

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:48.230
There's not a great big spurt of blood
and you go flying backwards.

00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:51.631
The impact isn't spread
over a wide area,

00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:54.712
it's tightly focused so there's little
or no energy transfer.

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:57.354
You stay still and the
bullet pushes through.

00:34:57.680 --> 00:35:00.592
You're almost certainly going to die,
so we need to focus.

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.558
I said focus!

00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:10.032
It's all well and clever
having a mind palace

00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:12.350
but you've only three seconds
of consciousness left to use it.

00:35:12.640 --> 00:35:14.392
So come on, what's going to kill you?

00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:17.159
- Blood loss.
- Exactly.

00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:19.356
So, it's all about one thing now,

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:21.351
forwards or backwards.

00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:23.749
You need to decide which way
you're going to fall.

00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:26.035
- One hole or two?
- Sorry?

00:35:26.560 --> 00:35:29.074
Is the bullet still inside you
or is there an exit wound?

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:30.389
It will depend on the gun.

00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:32.919
That one, I think.

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:34.878
Or that one.

00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:37.599
Oh, for God's sake, Sherlock,

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:40.194
it doesn't matter about the gun,
don't be stupid.

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.116
You always were so stupid.

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:45.159
Such a disappointment.

00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:46.914
I'm not stupid.

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.195
You're a very stupid little boy.

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:51.796
Mummy and Daddy are very cross,

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:54.913
because it doesn't matter
about the gun.

00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:56.269
Why not?

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:58.316
You saw the whole room
when you entered it.

00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:00.989
What was directly behind you
when you were murdered?

00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:02.799
Not been murdered yet.

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:06.358
Balance of probability, little brother.

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.112
If the bullet had passed through you,
what would you have heard?

00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.315
The mirror shattering.

00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:15.432
You didn't, therefore...

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.277
The bullet's still inside me.

00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:20.757
So we need
to take him down backwards.

00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:23.673
I agree.
Sherlock, you need to fall on your back.

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:25.956
Right now the bullet
is the cork in a bottle.

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:28.435
The bullet itself is blocking
most of the blood flow.

00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:31.677
But any pressure or impact on
the entrance wound could dislodge it.

00:36:32.080 --> 00:36:35.390
Plus, on your back,
gravity is working for us.

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:37.234
Fall now.

00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:54.558
What is that? What's happening?

00:36:57.640 --> 00:37:00.074
You're going into shock. It's the next
thing that's going to kill you.

00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:02.720
- What do I do?
- Don't go into shock, obviously.

00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:05.675
Must be something in this
ridiculous memory palace

00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:08.149
of yours that can calm you down.

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:10.389
Find it.

00:37:12.080 --> 00:37:13.877
The east wind is coming, Sherlock.

00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:17.992
It's coming to get you.

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:23.751
Pain containment.

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:30.076
Hello, Redbeard.
Here, boy. Come on, come to me.

00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:32.193
It's okay, it's all right.

00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:34.433
Come on, it's me. It's me, come on.

00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:35.669
Come on.

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:37.398
Good boy, clever boy.

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:41.319
Hello, Redbeard.
They're putting me down, too, now.

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:46.239
It's no fun, is it? Redbeard.

00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:56.748
<i>Without the shock,</i>
<i>you're going to feel the pain.</i>

00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:01.389
There's a hole ripped through you.
Massive internal bleeding.

00:38:01.920 --> 00:38:04.275
You have to control the pain.

00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:09.716
Control, control, control.

00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:13.989
You.

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:18.157
You never felt pain, did you?

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:22.393
Why did you never feel pain?

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:24.956
You always feel it, Sherlock.

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:33.714
But you don't have to fear it!

00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:43.194
Pain.

00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:44.909
Heartbreak.

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:47.909
Loss.

00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:51.915
Death.

00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:54.195
It's all good.

00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:57.629
It's all good.

00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:00.918
Sherlock? Sherlock, can you hear me?

00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:03.596
- What happened?
- He got shot.

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:04.669
Jesus.

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:07.156
Sherlock! Oh my...

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.069
Who shot him?

00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:11.196
<i>Emergency, which service do you require?</i>

00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:15.832
- It's raining, it's pouring

00:39:16.920 --> 00:39:21.072
- It's raining, it's pouring

00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:26.552
- It's raining, I'm crying

00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:31.433
- Sherlock is dying -

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.352
We're losing you. Sherlock!

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:39.473
Come on, Sherlock.

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:42.191
Just die, why can't you?

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.111
One little push

00:39:45.200 --> 00:39:46.394
and off you pop.

00:39:55.720 --> 00:39:59.076
You're going to love being dead,
Sherlock. No one ever bothers you.

00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:03.233
Mrs Hudson will cry.

00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:06.392
And Mummy and Daddy will cry.

00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:11.233
And the women will cry and John will cry
buckets and buckets.

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:15.114
It's him that I worry about the most.
That wife...

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:17.356
You're letting him down, Sherlock.

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:20.398
John Watson is definitely in danger.

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:37.117
Oh, you're not getting better, are you?

00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:39.430
Was it something I said, huh?

00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:44.513
Sherlock!

00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:38.112
- Mary.
- Hey.

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:40.198
He's only bloody woken up.

00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:41.914
- He's pulled through.
- Really?

00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.433
- Yeah, you...
- Seriously?

00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:46.434
<i>....</i> Mrs Watson. You're in big trouble.

00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:47.669
Really, why?

00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:48.795
His first word when he woke up?

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:50.669
Mary.

00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:11.632
You don't tell him.

00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:14.595
Sherlock!

00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:18.708
You don't tell John.

00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.113
Bad girl.

00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:29.628
Bad, bad girl.

00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:32.909
Look at me.

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:36.032
And tell me you're
not going to tell him.

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:46.953
I'm buying a cottage.

00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:50.078
I made a lot of money
out of you, Mister.

00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:52.237
Nothing hits the spot
like revenge with profits.

00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:54.875
You didn't give these stories
to Magnussen, did you?

00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:57.235
God no. One of his rivals,

00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:59.032
- he was spittin'.
- Hmm.

00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:04.319
Sherlock Holmes, you are a backstabbing,
heartless, manipulative bastard.

00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:07.315
You, as it turns out,
are a grasping, opportunistic,

00:43:07.400 --> 00:43:09.914
publicity-hungry, tabloid whore.

00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:12.671
- So we're good, then?
- Yeah, of course.

00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:14.909
Where's the cottage?

00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.035
Sussex Downs.

00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:18.076
- Oh, nice.
- It's gorgeous.

00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:20.231
There's beehives
but I'm getting rid of those.

00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:23.233
Oh, it hurts, does it?

00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:25.838
Might want to restart your morphine.

00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:27.353
I might have fiddled with the taps.

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:29.078
How much more revenge
are you going to need?

00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:30.593
Just the occasional top-up.

00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:33.310
Dream come true for you, this place.

00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:35.312
They actually attach the drugs to you.

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:36.959
Not good for working.

00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:39.953
You won't be working
for a while, Sherl.

00:43:40.160 --> 00:43:41.229
You lied to me.

00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:44.352
You lied and lied.

00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:46.635
I exploited the fact of our connection.

00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:48.678
- When?
- Hmm?

00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:51.670
Just once would have been nice.

00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:52.829
Oh.

00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:55.676
I was waiting till we got married.

00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:57.398
That was never going to happen.

00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:02.229
Got to go.

00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:06.358
I'm not supposed to keep you talking.

00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:07.429
And also,

00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:10.478
I have an interview with <i>The One Show</i>
and I haven't made it up yet.

00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:11.549
Oh.

00:44:13.200 --> 00:44:14.713
Just one thing.

00:44:15.360 --> 00:44:16.952
You shouldn't have lied to me.

00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:19.273
I know what kind of man you are.

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:22.916
We could have been friends.

00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:25.477
I'll give your love to John and Mary.

00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:44.989
You don't tell him.

00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.638
You don't tell John.

00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:49.994
So...

00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:54.071
you're Mary Watson.

00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:58.315
Who are you?

00:45:04.240 --> 00:45:05.719
Mary Watson.

00:45:15.600 --> 00:45:17.477
I don't know how much sense
you'll get out of him.

00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:19.869
He's drugged up,
so he's pretty much babbling.

00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:21.712
Oh, they won't let
you use that in here, you know.

00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:25.111
No, I'm not going to use the phone,
I just want to take a video.

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:26.389
Hmm.

00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:32.555
Oh, Jesus.

00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:36.629
So where would he go?

00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:37.755
Well, Christ knows.

00:45:38.760 --> 00:45:40.876
Try finding Sherlock in London.

00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:45.075
He's got
three known bolt-holes.

00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:48.357
Parliament Hill, Camden Lock
and Dagmar Court.

00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:49.714
Five known bolt-holes.

00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:51.552
There's the blind greenhouse
in Kew Gardens

00:45:51.640 --> 00:45:53.676
and the leaning tomb
in Hampstead Cemetery.

00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:55.714
Just a spare bedroom.

00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:57.518
Well, my bedroom.

00:45:58.040 --> 00:45:59.553
We agreed he needs the space.

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:04.791
Behind the clock face of Big Ben.

00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:06.799
I think he was probably joking.

00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:08.313
No, I don't think so.

00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:11.233
Leinster Gardens, that's his
number one bolt-hole.

00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:12.753
It's top, top secret.

00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:14.717
He only knows about it
because he stalked him one night.

00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:17.268
- Followed.
- Followed, yeah.

00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:19.074
He knew who shot him.

00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:22.433
The bullet wound was here,
so he was facing whoever it was.

00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:24.511
So why not tell us?

00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:26.113
Because he's tracking
them down himself...

00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:27.189
Or protecting them.

00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:28.395
Protecting the shooter, why?

00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:30.994
Well, protecting someone, then.
But why would he care?

00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:33.719
He's Sherlock, who would
he bother protecting?

00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:37.953
Call me if you hear anything,
don't hold out on me, John.

00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:39.871
- Call me, okay?
- Yeah. Yeah, right.

00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:41.795
Okay, goodnight, then.

00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:43.875
Bye, then.

00:46:45.560 --> 00:46:47.437
John, need a cuppa?

00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:51.349
Mrs Hudson, why does Sherlock think
that I'll be moving back in here?

00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:54.040
Oh, yes, he's put your
chair back again, hasn't he?

00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:57.192
That's nice. Looks much better.

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:02.233
John, what's wrong? Tell me.

00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:03.549
- John.

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:05.517
That's your phone, isn't it?

00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:09.236
It's Sherlock, John. It's Sherlock.

00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:12.511
John, you have to answer it!

00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:19.268
- Spare any change, love?
- No.

00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:21.351
Oh, come on, love,
don't be like all the rest.

00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:28.912
Rule one of looking for Sherlock Holmes,
he finds you.

00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.116
You're working for Sherlock now.

00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:33.912
Keeps me off the streets, innit?

00:47:34.040 --> 00:47:35.917
Well, no.

00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:42.075
Where are you?

00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:43.149
<i>Can't you see me?</i>

00:47:43.360 --> 00:47:44.759
What am I looking for?

00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:48.956
<i>The lie, the lie of Leinster Gardens</i>
<i>hidden in plain sight.</i>

00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:53.833
<i>Hardly anyone notices, people live</i>
<i>here for years and never see it</i>

00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:57.196
<i>but if you are what I think you are,</i>
<i>it'll take you less than a minute.</i>

00:47:57.520 --> 00:48:01.069
<i>The houses, Mary. Look at the houses.</i>

00:48:01.280 --> 00:48:02.793
How did you know I'd come here?

00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:05.792
<i>Well, I knew you'd talk to the people</i>
<i>no one else would bother with.</i>

00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:08.868
I thought I was being clever.

00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:11.633
<i>You're always clever, Mary,</i>
<i>I was relying on that.</i>

00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:14.349
<i>I planted the information</i>
<i>for you to find.</i>

00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:15.953
Ohhh!

00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:18.155
<i>30 seconds.</i>

00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:19.594
What am I looking at?

00:48:19.920 --> 00:48:23.117
<i>No door knobs, no letterbox,</i>
<i>painted windows.</i>

00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:28.715
<i>23 and 24 Leinster Gardens.</i>
<i>The empty houses.</i>

00:48:29.840 --> 00:48:32.752
<i>They were demolished years ago</i>
<i>to make way for the London Underground.</i>

00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:35.549
<i>Vents for the old steam trains.</i>

00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:39.870
<i>Only the very front section of the house</i>
<i>remains, it's just a facade.</i>

00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:42.998
<i>Remind you of anyone, Mary?</i>

00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:44.589
<i>A facade.</i>

00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:49.234
<i>Sorry, I never could resist</i>
<i>a touch of drama.</i>

00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:54.760
<i>Do come in. It's a little cramped.</i>

00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:56.229
Do you own this place?

00:48:56.320 --> 00:48:59.995
<i>Mmm. I won it in a card game</i>
<i>with the Clarence House cannibal.</i>

00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:04.676
<i>Nearly cost me my kidneys</i>
<i>but fortunately, I had a straight flush.</i>

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.831
<i>Quite a gambler, that woman.</i>

00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:14.519
What do you want, Sherlock?

00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:18.634
<i>Mary Morstan was stillborn</i>
<i>in October, 1972.</i>

00:49:20.120 --> 00:49:24.159
<i>Her gravestone is in Chiswick Cemetery,</i>
<i>where five years ago,</i>

00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:27.596
<i>you acquired her name and date of birth</i>
<i>and thereafter, her identity.</i>

00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:31.597
<i>That's why you don't have friends</i>
<i>from before that date.</i>

00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:34.919
Need to work on your half
of the church, Mary.

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.149
Looking a bit thin.

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:38.879
Oh, orphan's lot.
Friends, that's all I have.

00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:42.437
<i>It's an old enough technique,</i>
<i>known to the kinds of people</i>

00:49:42.520 --> 00:49:44.829
<i>who could recognise</i>
<i>a skip code on sight.</i>

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:47.919
At first I thought it was just a Bible
thing, you know, spam, but it's not.

00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:49.953
It's a skip code.

00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:52.914
<i>And extraordinarily retentive memories.</i>

00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.468
How can you not remember which room?
You remember everything.

00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:57.551
- I have to delete something!
-207

00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:00.113
You were very slow.

00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:03.112
<i>How good a shot are you?</i>

00:50:04.760 --> 00:50:06.671
How badly do you want to find out?

00:50:07.040 --> 00:50:09.235
<i>If I die here, my body</i>
<i>will be found in a building</i>

00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:11.675
<i>with your face</i>
<i>projected on the front of it,</i>

00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:13.796
<i>even Scotland Yard could</i>
<i>get somewhere with that.</i>

00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:17.237
<i>I want to know how good you are.</i>

00:50:17.720 --> 00:50:19.073
<i>Go on, show me.</i>

00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:22.755
<i>The doctor's wife must be</i>
<i>a little bit bored by now.</i>

00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:38.838
May I see?

00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:43.712
A dummy?

00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:45.832
Well, I suppose that was
a fairly obvious trick.

00:50:54.640 --> 00:51:00.670
And yet, over a distance of six feet
you failed to make a kill shot.

00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:06.593
Enough to hospitalise me,
not enough to kill me.

00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:09.192
That wasn't a miss.

00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:12.073
That was surgery.

00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:18.071
- I'll take the case.
- What case?

00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:19.229
Yours.

00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:22.636
Why didn't you come to me
in the first place?

00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:25.155
Because John can't ever know
that I lied to him.

00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:29.030
It would break him
and I would lose him forever

00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:31.509
and Sherlock, I will never
let that happen.

00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:34.109
Please.

00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:36.039
Understand.

00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:41.148
There is nothing in this world
I would not do to stop that happening.

00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:42.989
Sorry.

00:51:45.320 --> 00:51:46.753
Not that obvious a trick.

00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:53.429
Oh.

00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:03.513
Now, talk

00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:05.272
and sort it out and do it quickly.

00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:20.955
<i>(HARK! THE HERALD ANGELS SING</i>
PLAYING ON STEREO)

00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:23.634
Oh, dear God. It's only 2:00.

00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:26.314
It's been Christmas Day
for at least a week now.

00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:29.631
How can it only be 2:00? I am in agony.

00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:31.711
Mikey, is this your laptop?

00:52:31.800 --> 00:52:34.473
Upon which depends
the security of the free world, yes.

00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:35.993
And you've got potatoes on it.

00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:38.640
Well, you shouldn't leave it
lying around, if it's so important.

00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:40.836
Why are we doing this? We never do this.

00:52:40.920 --> 00:52:43.593
We are here because Sherlock is home
from hospital

00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:45.796
and we are all very happy.

00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:47.518
Am I happy, too? I haven't checked.

00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:48.953
Behave, Mike.

00:52:49.040 --> 00:52:50.359
Mycroft is the name you gave me,

00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:52.317
if you could possibly struggle
all the way to the end.

00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:53.549
Mrs Holmes.

00:52:54.600 --> 00:52:55.919
Oh, thank you, dear.

00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:58.756
Not absolutely sure why you're here.

00:52:58.840 --> 00:53:00.114
I invited him.

00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:02.191
I'm his prot?g?, Mrs Holmes.

00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:04.999
When he dies,
I get all his stuff and hisjob.

00:53:05.360 --> 00:53:07.510
- Nope.
- Oh. Well, I'll help out a bit.

00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:09.632
Closer.

00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:11.392
If he does get murdered or something.

00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:12.515
Probably stop talking now.

00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:13.589
Okay.

00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:15.352
Lovely when you bring
your friends round.

00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:16.634
Stop it, you.

00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:18.876
Somebody has put a bullet in my boy

00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:22.555
and if I ever find out who,
I shall turn absolutely monstrous.

00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:26.428
Ah, this was for Mary.
I'll be back in a minute.

00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:32.671
Ah, Mary.

00:53:32.760 --> 00:53:34.955
There you are. Cup of tea.

00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:36.871
Now, if Father starts making
little humming noises,

00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:39.713
just give him a little poke,
that usually does it.

00:53:39.800 --> 00:53:42.109
- Did you write this?

00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:44.111
Oh, that silly old thing.
You mustn't read that.

00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:47.398
Mathematics does seem
terribly fatuous now.

00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:50.313
Now, no humming, you!

00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:55.596
Complete flake, my wife,
but happens to be a genius.

00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:56.829
She was a mathematician?

00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:58.558
Gave it all up for children.

00:53:59.240 --> 00:54:02.516
I could never bear to argue with her.

00:54:02.600 --> 00:54:04.955
I'm something of a moron myself

00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:06.435
But she's...

00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:08.959
unbelievably hot.

00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:10.871
Oh, my God.

00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:14.199
You're the sane one, aren't you?

00:54:14.280 --> 00:54:15.872
Aren't you?

00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:21.588
Oh, sorry. I just...

00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:26.633
Oh. Do you two need a moment?

00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:27.835
If you don't mind.

00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:33.712
No, of course not. I'll go see if I can
help with something or another.

00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:44.071
Those two.

00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:45.479
They all right?

00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:48.552
Well, you know,
they've had their ups and downs.

00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:54.551
Baker Street. Now.

00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:06.989
John.

00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:09.873
Mary.

00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:14.918
Oh, Sherlock.
Oh, good gracious, you look terrible.

00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:17.198
Get me some morphine from your kitchen,
I've run out.

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:18.474
I don't have any morphine.

00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:20.591
Then what exactly is the point of you?

00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:22.479
What is going on?

00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:23.589
Bloody good question.

00:55:23.800 --> 00:55:26.314
The Watsons are about to have
a domestic and fairly quickly, I hope,

00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:27.753
because we've got work to do.

00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:28.829
No, I have a better question.

00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:33.278
Is everyone I have ever met
a psychopath?

00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:35.749
Yes.

00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:37.474
Good that we've settled that.

00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:39.152
- <i>Now....</i>
- Shut up!

00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:42.878
And stay shut up.
Because this is not funny.

00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:44.549
Not this time.

00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:46.398
- I didn't say it was funny.
- You...

00:55:47.720 --> 00:55:49.233
What have I ever done?

00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:50.988
Hmm?

00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:53.834
My whole life, to deserve you?

00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:55.549
Everything.

00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:57.073
Sherlock, I told you,

00:55:57.480 --> 00:55:58.708
shut up.

00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:00.279
No, I mean it, seriously. Everything.

00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:02.277
Everything you've ever done
is what you did.

00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:05.039
Sherlock, one more word
and you will not need morphine.

00:56:05.120 --> 00:56:06.951
You were a doctor who went to war.

00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:09.918
You're a man who couldn't stay
in the suburbs for more than a month

00:56:10.000 --> 00:56:12.309
without storming a crack den
and beating up a junkie.

00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:14.039
Your best friend is a sociopath

00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:16.998
who solves crimes
as an alternative to getting high.

00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:18.433
That's me, by the way. Hello.

00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:20.397
Even the landlady used to run
a drug cartel.

00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:23.314
It was my husband's cartel.
I was just typing.

00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:25.159
And exotic dancing.

00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:27.470
Sherlock Holmes,
if you've been YouTubing...

00:56:27.560 --> 00:56:30.552
John, you are addicted
to a certain lifestyle.

00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:35.593
You're abnormally attracted to
dangerous situations and people,

00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:39.673
so is it truly such a surprise
that the woman you fall in love with

00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:42.039
conforms to that pattern?

00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:44.839
But she wasn't supposed to be like that.

00:56:48.520 --> 00:56:50.033
Why is she like that?

00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:54.911
Because you chose her.

00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:02.839
Why is everything always...

00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:05.869
- my fault!
- Ooh, the neighbours.

00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:08.951
John, listen. Be calm and answer me.

00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:10.834
What is she?

00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:13.596
- My lying wife?
- No, what is she?

00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:15.833
And the woman who's carrying my child

00:57:15.920 --> 00:57:17.558
who has lied to me
since the day I met her?

00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:20.518
No, not in this flat,
not in this room.

00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:24.479
Right here, right now, what is she?

00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:28.754
Okay.

00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:33.674
Your way.

00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:36.869
Always your way.

00:57:44.080 --> 00:57:45.115
Sit.

00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:46.469
Why?

00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:48.637
Because that's where they sit.

00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:52.197
The people who come in here
with their stories.

00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:54.716
The clients.
That's all you are now, Mary.

00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:55.789
You're a client.

00:57:57.320 --> 00:58:00.278
This is where you sit and talk
and this is where we sit and listen.

00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:02.471
Then we decide if we want you or not.

00:58:33.640 --> 00:58:35.039
So you're okay?

00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:38.830
Oh! Are we doing conversation today?

00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:40.353
It really is Christmas.

00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:45.191
Now?

00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:50.912
Seriously? Months of silence
and we're going to do this now?

00:58:59.080 --> 00:59:00.593
A-G-R-A. What's that?

00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:03.549
Uh...

00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:05.389
My initials.

00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:11.918
Everything about who I was is on there.

00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:13.672
If you love me,
don't read it in front of me.

00:59:14.280 --> 00:59:15.429
Why?

00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:18.954
Because you won't love me
when you've finished.

00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:21.751
And I don't want to see that happen.

00:59:29.840 --> 00:59:30.829
How much do you know already?

00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:34.431
By your skill set, you are or were
an intelligence agent.

00:59:35.680 --> 00:59:38.638
Your accent is currently English
but I suspect you are not.

00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:40.472
You're on the run from something.

00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:42.039
You've used your skills to disappear.

00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:44.509
Magnussen knows your secret,
which is why you were going to kill him

00:59:44.600 --> 00:59:47.876
and I assume you befriended Janine
in order to get close to him.

00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:49.269
Oh, you can talk.

00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:52.792
Oh, look at you two.
You should have got married.

00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:54.755
The stuff Magnussen has on me,

00:59:54.840 --> 00:59:56.558
I would go to prison
for the rest of my life.

00:59:56.760 --> 00:59:57.795
So you were just going to kill him?

00:59:58.040 --> 01:00:00.838
People like Magnussen should be killed.
That's why there are people like me.

01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:02.279
Perfect!

01:00:02.360 --> 01:00:05.238
So that's what you were?
An assassin? How could I not see that?

01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:06.639
You did see that.

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:11.477
And you married me.

01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:14.119
Because he's right.

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:18.192
It's what you like.

01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:24.716
So, Mary...

01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:29.156
Any documents that Magnussen has
concerning yourself, you want...

01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:31.511
extracted and returned.

01:00:32.440 --> 01:00:33.839
Why would you help me?

01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:35.831
Because you saved my life.

01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:37.319
Sorry, sorry, what?

01:00:37.840 --> 01:00:39.398
When I happened on you and Magnussen,

01:00:42.200 --> 01:00:43.679
you had a problem.

01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:47.511
More specifically, you had a witness.

01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:52.118
<i>What do you do now?</i>

01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:56.912
<i>Kill the both of us?</i>

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:00.752
<i>This solution,</i>
<i>of course, was simple.</i>

01:01:00.840 --> 01:01:02.717
<i>Kill us both and leave.</i>

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:16.435
However,
sentiment got the better of you.

01:01:19.120 --> 01:01:22.510
<i>One precisely calculated shot</i>
<i>to incapacitate me</i>

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.675
<i>in the hope that it would bide you</i>
<i>more time to negotiate my silence.</i>

01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:29.191
Of course, you couldn't shoot Magnussen.

01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:31.350
On the night that both of us
broke into the building

01:01:31.440 --> 01:01:34.079
your own husband
would become a suspect so...

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:40.351
You calculated

01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:43.989
that Magnussen would use the fact
of your involvement

01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:48.437
rather than sharing the information
with the police, as is his MO.

01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:53.078
And then you left the way you came.

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.719
- Have I missed anything?
- How did she save your life?

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:00.836
- She phoned the ambulance.
- I phoned the ambulance.

01:02:00.920 --> 01:02:02.273
She phoned first.

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:08.552
<i>Emergency, which service</i>
<i>do you require?</i>

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:09.959
You didn't find me
for another five minutes.

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:11.359
Left to you, I would have died.

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:14.477
The average arrival time
for a London ambulance is...

01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:17.594
Did somebody call an ambulance?
Eight minutes.

01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:19.636
Did you bring any morphine?
I asked on the phone.

01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:22.996
- We were told there was a shooting.
- There was, last week.

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:25.709
But I believe I'm bleeding internally.
My pulse is very erratic.

01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:27.119
You may need to restart my heart.

01:02:27.200 --> 01:02:30.715
- Whoa.
- John... John.

01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:35.392
John, Magnussen is all that matters now.

01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:37.717
You can trust Mary.

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:39.472
- She saved my life.
- She shot you.

01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:43.074
Uh, mixed messages,
I grant you. That is a...

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:45.958
- Sherlock... Sherlock. Take him.

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:47.917
- Got him?
Yeah.

01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:02.753
So, have you read it?

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:10.189
- Would you come here a moment?
- No. Tell me, have you?

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:12.396
Just come here.

01:03:15.600 --> 01:03:16.635
No, I'm fine.

01:03:22.800 --> 01:03:26.270
I've thought long and hard about
what I want to say to you.

01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:30.269
These are prepared words, Mary.

01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:32.828
- I've chosen these words with care.
- Okay...

01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:37.310
The problems of your past

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:38.515
are your business.

01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:43.473
The problems of your future

01:03:43.880 --> 01:03:45.074
are my privilege.

01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:48.511
That's all I have to say,
that's all I need to know.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.709
No, I didn't read it.

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:04.472
You don't even know my name.

01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:09.112
- Is Mary Watson good enough for you?
- Yes.

01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:11.670
- Oh, my God, yes.
- Then it's good enough for me, too.

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:13.113
Oh...

01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:20.516
All this does not mean that I'm not
still basically pissed off with you.

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:21.794
I know, I know.

01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:24.917
I am very pissed off
and it will come out now and then.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.399
I know, I know, I know.

01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:30.673
You can mow the sodding lawn
from now on.

01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:32.432
- I do mow the lawn.
- I do it loads.

01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:33.714
You really don't.

01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:35.392
- I choose the baby's name.
- Not a chance.

01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:36.993
Okay.

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:39.637
I'm glad you've given up
on the Magnussen business.

01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:41.199
Are you?

01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:42.872
I'm still curious, though.

01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:46.111
It's hardly your usual kind of puzzle.
Why do you hate him?

01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:47.918
Because he attacks
people who are different

01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:50.833
and preys on their secrets.
Why don't you?

01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:53.673
He never causes too much damage
to anyone important.

01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:55.432
He's far too intelligent for that.

01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:57.351
He's a businessman, that's all.

01:04:57.440 --> 01:04:59.715
And occasionally useful to us.

01:04:59.800 --> 01:05:03.076
A necessary evil.
Not a dragon for you to slay.

01:05:04.320 --> 01:05:06.311
A dragon-slayer.

01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:08.874
- Is that what you think of me?
- No.

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:10.757
It's what you think of yourself

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:12.273
Are you two smoking?

01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:13.873
- No!
- It was Mycroft.

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:20.359
I have, by the way,

01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:23.398
a job offer
I should like you to decline.

01:05:23.520 --> 01:05:26.637
- I decline your kind offer.
- I shall pass on your regrets.

01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:28.517
- What was it?
- Ml6.

01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:31.160
They want to place you back
into Eastern Europe.

01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:33.834
An undercover assignment
that will prove fatal to you

01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:37.071
in, I think, about six months.

01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:39.357
Then why don't you want me to take it?

01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.357
It's tempting but on balance, you have
more utility closer to home.

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:47.000
Utility.
How do I have utility?

01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:50.079
Here be dragons.

01:05:51.640 --> 01:05:54.279
This isn't agreeing with me.

01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:55.793
I'm going in.

01:05:55.880 --> 01:05:58.155
You need low tar.

01:05:58.240 --> 01:05:59.798
You still smoke like a beginner.

01:06:01.520 --> 01:06:02.714
Also...

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:07.193
- your loss would break my heart.

01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:10.633
What the hell
am I supposed to say to that?

01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:15.396
- Merry Christmas?
- You hate Christmas.

01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:16.549
Yes.

01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:19.079
Perhaps there was something
in the punch.

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:20.798
Clearly. Go and have some more.

01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:26.598
So you realise
that Sherlock got us

01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:28.318
out here to see
his mum and dad for a reason?

01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:30.595
His lovely mum and dad.
Fine example of married life,

01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:32.079
I get that.

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:36.076
That is the thing with Sherlock.
It's always the unexpected.

01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:38.515
Oi... Oi...

01:06:38.600 --> 01:06:41.319
Mary? Jesus Christ, Mary?

01:06:41.400 --> 01:06:43.470
Sit down. Mary, can you hear me?

01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:46.791
Don't drink Mary's tea.

01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:51.756
Oh, or the punch.

01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:58.232
Sherlock?

01:06:59.040 --> 01:07:00.996
Did you just drug my pregnant wife?

01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:03.275
Don't worry.
Wiggins is an excellent chemist.

01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:05.510
I calculated your wife 's dose meself

01:07:05.600 --> 01:07:07.716
Won't affect the little one.
I'll keep an eye on her.

01:07:07.800 --> 01:07:10.075
He'll monitor their recovery.
It's more or less his dayjob.

01:07:10.520 --> 01:07:12.078
What the hell have you done?

01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:15.794
Deal with the Devil.

01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:24.514
Shouldn't you be in hospital?

01:07:25.040 --> 01:07:28.476
I am in hospital. This is the canteen.

01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:30.551
- Is it?
- In my opinion, yes.

01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:31.959
Have a seat.

01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:33.395
Thank you.

01:07:34.600 --> 01:07:36.318
I've been thinking about you.

01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:39.071
I've been thinking about you.

01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:40.675
Really?

01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:47.470
I want to see Appledore.

01:07:48.520 --> 01:07:50.238
Where you keep all the secrets,

01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:52.709
all the files,
everything you've got on everyone.

01:07:53.440 --> 01:07:56.238
I want you to invite me.

01:07:58.520 --> 01:08:00.795
What makes you think
I'd be so careless?

01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:05.831
Oh, I think you're a lot more careless
than you let on.

01:08:08.480 --> 01:08:09.629
Am I?

01:08:14.240 --> 01:08:16.959
It's the dead-eye stare
that gives it away.

01:08:18.600 --> 01:08:21.910
Except it's not dead-eyed, is it?

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:29.111
You're reading.

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:33.511
Portable Appledore.

01:08:34.880 --> 01:08:35.949
How does it work?

01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:39.236
Built-in flash drive?

01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:42.717
4G wireless?

01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:58.352
They're just ordinary spectacles.

01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:02.119
Yes, they are.

01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.116
You underestimate me, Mr Holmes.

01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:26.757
Impress me, then.

01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:28.478
Show me Appledore.

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:31.511
Everything's available for a price.

01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:34.076
- You making me an offer?
- A Christmas present.

01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:38.435
Then what are you giving me
for Christmas, Mr Holmes?

01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:41.153
My brother.

01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:46.999
Jesus.

01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:54.675
Sherlock, please tell me
you haven't just gone out of your mind.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.399
I'd rather keep you guessing.

01:09:58.440 --> 01:09:59.793
- Ah! There's our lift.

01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:09.111
- Coming?
- Where?

01:10:09.800 --> 01:10:11.597
- Want your wife to be safe?
- Yeah, of course I do.

01:10:11.680 --> 01:10:13.398
Good, because this is going to be
incredibly dangerous.

01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:15.232
One false move and we'll have
betrayed the security

01:10:15.320 --> 01:10:17.470
of the United Kingdom and be imprisoned
for high treason.

01:10:17.560 --> 01:10:20.233
Magnussen is quite simply the most
dangerous man we've ever encountered

01:10:20.320 --> 01:10:22.709
and the odds are comprehensively
stacked against us.

01:10:23.280 --> 01:10:25.032
But it's Christmas.

01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:27.350
I feel the same.
Oh, you mean it's actually Christmas.

01:10:27.440 --> 01:10:28.634
Did you bring your gun as I suggested?

01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:29.789
Why would I bring my gun

01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:31.279
to your parents' house
for Christmas dinner?

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:32.634
- Is it in your coat?
- Yes.

01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:34.153
- Off we go, then.
- Where are we going?

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:35.309
Appledore.

01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:34.838
I would offer you a drink
but it's very rare and expensive.

01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:43.715
Oh. It was you.

01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:45.552
Yes, of course.

01:11:45.640 --> 01:11:47.676
Very hard to find
a pressure point on you, Mr Holmes.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:49.194
Hmm.

01:11:49.280 --> 01:11:51.236
The drugs thing I never believed
for a moment.

01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:55.070
Anyway, you wouldn't care
if it was exposed, would you?

01:11:56.920 --> 01:11:59.912
But look how you care about John Watson.

01:12:01.320 --> 01:12:03.038
Your damsel in distress.

01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:05.952
You...

01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:09.350
put me in a fire for leverage?

01:12:09.440 --> 01:12:12.159
Oh, I'd never let you burn, Dr Watson.

01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:13.958
I had people standing by.

01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:17.596
I am not a murderer.

01:12:18.760 --> 01:12:19.954
Unlike your wife.

01:12:25.400 --> 01:12:29.393
Let me explain how leverage works,
Dr Watson.

01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:33.636
For those who understand these things,

01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:36.757
Mycroft Holmes is the most powerful man
in the country.

01:12:37.440 --> 01:12:39.590
Well, apart from me.

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:44.999
Mycroft 's pressure point is his
junkie detective brother Sherlock.

01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:48.718
Sherlock's pressure point
is his best friend John Watson.

01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:50.950
John Watson's pressure point
is his wife.

01:12:51.600 --> 01:12:53.591
I own John Watson's wife,

01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:54.999
I own Mycroft.

01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:58.789
He's what I'm getting for Christmas.

01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:02.355
It's an exchange, not a gift.

01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:07.355
Forgive me but...

01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:13.150
- I already seem to have it.
- It's password protected.

01:13:16.480 --> 01:13:20.234
In return for the password, you will
give me any material in your possession

01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:22.629
pertaining to the woman
I know as Mary Watson.

01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:24.631
Oh, she's bad, that one.

01:13:25.520 --> 01:13:27.875
So many dead people.

01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:30.520
- You should see what I've seen.
- I don't need to see it.

01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:32.591
Well, you might enjoy it, though.

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:34.075
I enjoy it.

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:37.439
Then, why don't you show us?

01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:39.559
Show you Appledore?

01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:41.551
The secret vaults?

01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:43.193
Is that what you want?

01:13:43.280 --> 01:13:47.432
I want everything you've got on Mary.

01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:57.518
You know,

01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:00.111
I honestly expected something good.

01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:02.270
Oh, I think you'll find
the contents of that laptop...

01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:03.918
Include the GPS locator.

01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:07.955
By now your brother
will have noticed the theft

01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:11.476
and Security Services
will be converging on this house.

01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:15.872
Having arrived, they'll find
top secret information in my hands.

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:18.918
And they'll have every justification
to search my vaults.

01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:23.319
They will discover further information
of this kind, then I'll be imprisoned.

01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:25.954
You will be exonerated.

01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:28.790
Restored to your smelly little apartment

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:31.553
to solve crimes
with Mr and Mrs Psychopath.

01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:36.879
Mycroft has been looking
for this opportunity for a long time.

01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:41.916
He'll be a very, very proud big brother.

01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:45.514
The fact that you know it's going
to happen isn't going to stop it.

01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:48.273
Then why am I smiling?

01:14:49.520 --> 01:14:51.158
Ask me.

01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:53.952
Why are you smiling?

01:14:55.200 --> 01:14:58.556
Because Sherlock Holmes has made
one enormous mistake

01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:02.118
which will destroy the lives
of everyone he loves

01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:05.990
and everything he holds dear.

01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:13.519
Let me show you the Appledore vaults.

01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:27.549
The entrance to my vaults.

01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:30.277
This is where I keep you all.

01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:46.195
Okay.
So where are the vaults, then?

01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:48.635
Vaults? What vaults?

01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:51.669
There are no vaults
beneath this building.

01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:54.868
They're all in here.

01:15:57.400 --> 01:16:01.234
The Appledore vaults
are my mind palace.

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.673
You know about mind palaces,
don't you, Sherlock?

01:16:04.800 --> 01:16:07.712
How to store information
so you never forget it,

01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:09.633
by picturing it.

01:16:10.160 --> 01:16:13.516
I just sit here, I close my eyes

01:16:14.200 --> 01:16:16.589
and down I go to my vaults.

01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:23.156
I can go anywhere inside my vaults.

01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:26.432
<i>My memories.</i>

01:16:32.520 --> 01:16:35.512
I'll look at the files on Mrs Watson.

01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:49.273
Oh, this is one of my favourites.

01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:51.599
Oh, it's so exciting.

01:16:53.760 --> 01:16:57.548
All those whack jobs for the CIA.

01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:01.918
Ooh! She's gone a bit freelance now.

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.353
Bad girl.

01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:13.834
Oh, she's so wicked.

01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:17.594
I can really see why you like her.

01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:23.878
You see?

01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:25.552
So there are no documents,

01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:28.029
you don't actually have anything here?

01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:31.157
Oh, sometimes I send out for something
if I really need it but

01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:34.797
- mostly I just remember it all.
- I don't understand.

01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:37.348
- You should have that on a t-shirt.
- You just remember it all?

01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:39.749
It's all about knowledge.
Everything is.

01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:42.431
Knowing is owning.

01:17:42.520 --> 01:17:44.431
But if you just know it,
then you don't have proof

01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:46.670
Proof? What would I need proof for?

01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:49.230
I'm in news, you moron.

01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:51.788
I don't have to prove it,
I just have to print it.

01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:56.876
Speaking of news, you will both be
heavily featured tomorrow.

01:17:57.440 --> 01:18:00.113
Trying to sell state secrets to me.

01:18:03.120 --> 01:18:04.519
Let's go outside.

01:18:05.280 --> 01:18:08.795
They'll be here shortly.
Can't wait to see you arrested.

01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:12.276
Sherlock, do we have a plan?

01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:15.918
Sherlock?

01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:29.591
They're taking their time, aren't they?

01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:34.036
- I still don't understand.
- And there's the back of the t-shirt.

01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:37.511
You just know things.
How does that work?

01:18:37.600 --> 01:18:39.750
I just so love
your little soldier face.

01:18:39.840 --> 01:18:42.991
I'd like to punch it.
Bring it over here a minute.

01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:47.356
Come on, for Mary. Bring me your face.

01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:56.315
Lean forward a bit
and stick your face out.

01:18:58.640 --> 01:18:59.993
Please.

01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:04.917
Now, can I flick it?

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:09.754
Can I flick your face?

01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:18.951
Oh, I just love doing this.

01:19:19.040 --> 01:19:21.235
I could do it all day.

01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:23.996
It works like this, John.

01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:26.833
I know who Mary hurt and killed.

01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:30.473
I know where to find people
who hate her.

01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:36.190
I know where they live.
I know their phone numbers.

01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:42.157
All in my mind palace. All of it.

01:19:42.880 --> 01:19:45.553
I could phone them right now

01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:48.593
and tear your whole life down.

01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:50.079
And I will.

01:19:50.880 --> 01:19:54.395
Unless you let me flick your face.

01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:04.074
This is what I do to people.

01:20:04.160 --> 01:20:06.799
This is what I do to whole countries.

01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:10.352
Just because I know.

01:20:11.960 --> 01:20:13.871
Can I do your eye now?

01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:15.552
See if you can keep it open. Hmm?

01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:19.510
Come on, for Mary. Keep it open.

01:20:19.600 --> 01:20:23.115
Sherlock...
Let him, I'm sorry. Just...

01:20:23.200 --> 01:20:24.792
let him.

01:20:25.240 --> 01:20:27.390
Hmm? Come on, eye open.

01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:33.508
It's difficult, isn't it?

01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:36.878
Janine managed it once.

01:20:36.960 --> 01:20:39.190
She makes the funniest noises.

01:20:48.200 --> 01:20:51.795
<i>Sherlock Holmes and John Watson,</i>
<i>stand away from that man.</i>

01:20:52.440 --> 01:20:54.112
Here we go, Mr Holmes.

01:20:54.200 --> 01:20:58.716
To clarify, Appledore's vaults
only exist in your mind?

01:20:58.800 --> 01:21:00.392
Nowhere else. Just there.

01:21:00.480 --> 01:21:02.596
They're not real. They never have been.

01:21:03.520 --> 01:21:05.909
<i>Sherlock Holmes and John Watson.</i>

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.992
<i>- Step away.</i>
- It's fine.

01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:12.197
- They're harmless.
<i>Target not armed.</i>

01:21:12.440 --> 01:21:14.476
- Sherlock, what do we do?
- Nothing.

01:21:15.160 --> 01:21:16.991
There's nothing to be done.

01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:20.550
Oh, I'm not a villain.
I have no evil plan.

01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:23.354
I'm a businessman, acquiring assets.

01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:25.271
You happen to be one of them.

01:21:25.360 --> 01:21:29.592
Sorry. No chance for you
to be a hero this time, Mr Holmes.

01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:31.791
<i>Sherlock Holmes and John Watson,</i>

01:21:31.880 --> 01:21:34.952
<i>stand away from that man. Do it now.</i>

01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:37.754
Oh, do your research.

01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:39.876
I'm not a hero.

01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:42.235
I'm a high-functioning sociopath.

01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:44.311
Merry Christmas!

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:47.039
<i>Man down. Man down.</i>

01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:49.714
Get away from me, John! Stay well back.

01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:52.268
- Christ, Sherlock!
- <i>Don't fire.</i>

01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:54.676
<i>Do not fire on Sherlock Holmes.</i>

01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:56.239
<i>Do not fire!</i>

01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.911
Oh, Christ, Sherlock.

01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:04.558
Give my love to Mary.

01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:08.998
Tell her she's safe now.

01:22:38.600 --> 01:22:40.318
Oh, Sherlock.

01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:42.835
What have you done?

01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:55.070
As my colleague is fond of remarking,

01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:58.152
this country sometimes needs
a blunt instrument.

01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:00.708
Equally, it sometimes needs a dagger.

01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:05.636
A scalpel, wielded with precision
and without remorse.

01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:11.394
There will always come a time
when we need Sherlock Holmes.

01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:16.030
If this is some expression
of familial sentiment...

01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:17.269
Don't be absurd.

01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:20.750
I am not given to outbursts
of brotherly compassion.

01:23:22.320 --> 01:23:24.072
You know what happened to the other one.

01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:29.195
In any event, there is no prison
in which we could incarcerate Sherlock

01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:32.192
without causing a riot on a daily basis.

01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:35.270
The alternative, however,

01:23:35.720 --> 01:23:37.950
would require your approval.

01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:39.951
Hardly merciful, Mr Holmes.

01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:41.871
Regrettably, Lady Smallwood,

01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:45.431
my brother is a murderer.

01:23:58.360 --> 01:24:00.078
You will look after him
for me, won't you?

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:01.149
Oh!

01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:03.670
Don't worry, I'll keep him in trouble.

01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.353
That's my girl.

01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:14.238
Since this is likely to be the last
conversation I'll have with John Watson,

01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:15.992
would you mind if we took a moment?

01:24:25.280 --> 01:24:27.271
So here we are.

01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:31.673
- William Sherlock Scott Holmes.
- Sorry?

01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:34.554
That's the whole of it.
If you're looking for baby names.

01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:38.030
No, we've had a scan.
We're pretty sure it's a girl.

01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:40.511
Oh... Okay.

01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:46.788
Yeah...

01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:49.915
You know,
I can't think of a single thing to say.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:51.592
No, neither can I.

01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:56.311
- The game is over.
- The game is never over, John.

01:24:57.280 --> 01:24:59.111
But there may be some new players now.

01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:02.112
That's okay.
The east wind takes us all in the end.

01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:03.838
What's that?

01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:06.788
It's a story my brother told me
when we were kids.

01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:11.032
The east wind, this terrifying force
that lays waste to all in its path.

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:14.832
Seeks out the unworthy
and plucks them from the Earth.

01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:16.952
- That was generally me.
- Nice.

01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:18.393
He was a rubbish big brother.

01:25:19.920 --> 01:25:22.036
So what about you, then?

01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:25.071
Where are you actually going now?

01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:27.390
Oh, some undercover work
in Eastern Europe.

01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:30.355
- For how long?
- Six months,

01:25:30.440 --> 01:25:32.237
my brother estimates.

01:25:32.680 --> 01:25:34.272
He's never wrong.

01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:36.638
And then what?

01:25:39.520 --> 01:25:40.555
Who knows?

01:25:46.280 --> 01:25:48.555
John, there's something...

01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:53.390
I should say, I've meant to
say always and I never have.

01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:55.437
Since it's unlikely
we'll ever meet again,

01:25:55.520 --> 01:25:57.238
I might as well say it now.

01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:03.390
Sherlock is actually a girl's name.

01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:09.190
- It's not.
- It was worth a try.

01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:11.669
We're not naming our daughter after you.

01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:13.557
I think it could work.

01:26:19.720 --> 01:26:21.517
To the very best of times, John.

01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:11.234
<i>This one's good...</i>

01:27:11.320 --> 01:27:12.673
<i>Alexander comes in for a tackle...</i>

01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:14.955
Oh!
- <i>Oh, he missed it!</i>

01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:19.309
Oi, what's wrong the telly?
Something wrong with the telly, mate.

01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:21.197
Get it working!

01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:23.871
Who's that?
<i>Did you miss me?</i>

01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:27.236
<i>Did you miss me?</i>
<i>Did you miss me? Did you miss me?</i>

01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:29.629
- <i>Did you miss me?</i>
- How is this possible?

01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:32.553
We don't know.
But it's on every screen in the country,

01:27:32.640 --> 01:27:35.552
- every screen simultaneously.
- Has the Prime Minister been told?

01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:39.109
And Mycroft?

01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:43.079
But that's not possible.
That is simply not possible.

01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:46.269
What's happened?

01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:49.477
Sir? It's your brother.

01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:53.710
- Mycroft.
- <i>Hello, little brother.</i>

01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:56.633
- <i>How's the exile going?</i>
- I've only been gone four minutes.

01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:58.870
Well, I certainly hope
you've learnt your lesson.

01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:01.599
<i>As it turns out, you're needed.</i>

01:28:01.720 --> 01:28:03.950
Oh, for God's sake, make up your mind.

01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:06.108
Who needs me this time?

01:28:06.200 --> 01:28:09.636
<i>Did you miss me?</i>
<i>Did you miss me? Did you miss me?</i>

01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:13.315
<i>Did you miss me?</i>
<i>Did you miss me? Did you miss me?</i>

01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:14.913
<i>- Did you miss me?</i>
- England.

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.434
But he's dead. I mean, you told me
he was dead, Moriarty.

01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:19.272
Absolutely. He blew his own brains out.

01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:21.351
So how can he be back?

01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:25.592
Well, if he is,
he'd better wrap up warm.

01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:29.152
There's an east wind coming.

01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:07.034
Miss me?
